        <h1>14.3 System survivability</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p> &nbsp;So far, I have discussed security engineering from the perspective of an application that is
            under development. The system procurer and developer have control over all aspects of
            the system that might be attacked. In reality, as I suggested in Figure 14.1, modern dis
            tributed systems inevitably rely on an infrastructure that includes off-the-shelf systems
            and reusable components that have been developed by different organizations. The secu
            rity of these systems does not just depend on local design decisions. It is also affected by
            the security of external applications, web services, and the network infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p> &nbsp;This means that, irrespective of how much attention is paid to security, it cannot be
            guaranteed that a system will be able to resist external attacks. Consequently, for com
            plex networked systems, you should assume that penetration is possible and that the
            integrity of the system cannot be guaranteed. You should therefore think about how to
            make the system resilient so that it survives to deliver essential services to users.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;Survivability or resilience (Westmark, 2004) is an emergent property of a system
            as a whole, rather than a property of individual components, which may not them
            selves be survivable. The survivability of a system reflects its ability to continue to
            deliver essential business or mission-critical services to legitimate users while it is
            under attack or after part of the system has been damaged. The damage could be
            caused by an attack or by a system failure.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;Work on system survivability was prompted by the fact that our economic and social
            lives are dependent on a computer-controlled critical infrastructure. This includes the
            infrastructure for delivering utilities (power, water, gas, etc.) and, equally critically, the
            infrastructure for delivering and managing information (telephones, Internet, postal
            service, etc.). However, survivability is not simply a critical infrastructure issue. Any
            organization that relies on critical networked computer systems should be concerned
            with how its business would be affected if their systems did not survive a malicious
            attack or catastrophic system failure. Therefore, for business critical systems, surviv
            ability analysis and design should be part of the security engineering process.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;Maintaining the availability of critical services is the essence of survivability.
            This means that you have to know:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>the system services that are the most critical for a business;</p></li>
            <li><p>the minimal quality of service that must be maintained;</p></li>
            <li><p>how these services might be compromised;</p></li>
            <li><p>how these services can be protected;</p></li>
            <li><p>how you can recover quickly if the services become unavailable.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            &nbsp;For example, in a system that handles ambulance dispatch in response to emergency
            calls, the critical services are those concerned with taking calls and dispatching ambu
            lances to the medical emergency. Other services, such as call logging and ambulance
            location management, are less critical, either because they do not require real-time pro
            cessing or because alternative mechanisms may be used. For example, to find an ambu
            lanceâ€™s location you can call the ambulance crew and ask them where they are.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;Ellison and colleagues (1999a; 1999b; 2002) have designed a method of analysis
            called Survivable Systems Analysis. This is used to assess vulnerabilities in systems
            and to support the design of system architectures and features that promote system
            survivability. They argue that achieving survivability depends on three complemen
            tary strategies:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><em>Resistance</em> Avoiding problems by building capabilities into the system to repel
                    attacks. For example, a system may use digital certificates to authenticate users,
                    thus making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><em>Recognition</em> Detecting problems by building capabilities into the system to detect
                    attacks and failures and assess the resultant damage. For example, checksums may
                    be associated with critical data so that corruptions to that data can be detected.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Recovery</em> Tolerating problems by building capabilities into the system to deliver
                    essential services while under attack, and to recover full functionality after an attack. For
                    example, fault tolerance mechanisms using diverse implementations
                    of the same functionality may be included to cope with a loss of service from
                    one part of the system.
