            <p class="author">Written by <B> Axel Stephan Bunsay</B> and Designed by <B>David Emanuel Haboc</B></p>
            <p  class="indent-8 mt-4">Security risk assessment and management is essential for effective security engineering. Risk management is concerned with assessing the possible losses that might
                ensue from attacks on assets in the system, and balancing these losses against the costs of security procedures that may reduce these losses. Credit card companies do
                this all the time. It is relatively easy to introduce new technology to reduce credit
                card fraud. However, it is often cheaper for them to compensate users for their losses
                due to fraud than to buy and deploy fraud-reduction technology. As costs drop and
                attacks increase, this balance may change. For example, credit card companies are
                now encoding information on an on-card chip instead of a magnetic strip. This
                makes card copying much more difficult.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Risk management is a business issue rather than a technical issue so software
                engineers should not decide what controls should be included in a system. It is up
                to senior management to decide whether or not to accept the cost of security or the
                exposure that results from a lack of security procedures. Rather, the role of software engineers is to provide informed technical guidance and judgment on security issues. They are, therefore, essential participants in the risk management
                process.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">As I explained in Chapter 12, a critical input to the risk assessment and management process is the organizational security policy. The organizational security policy applies to all systems and should set out what should and should not
                be allowed. The security policy sets out conditions that should always be maintained by a security system and so helps to identify risks and threats that might
                arise. The security policy therefore defines what is and what is not allowed.
                In the security engineering process, you design the mechanisms to implement
                this policy.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Risk assessment starts before the decision to acquire the system has been made
                and should continue throughout the system development process and after the system has gone into use (Alberts and Dorofee, 2002). I also introduced, in Chapter 12,
                the idea that this risk assessment is a staged process:

                <ol class="list-dics pl-12 mt-5 list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><b>Preliminary risk assessment</b> - At this stage, decisions on the detailed system
                        requirements, the system design, or the implementation technology have not
                        been made. The aim of this assessment process is to decide if an adequate level
                        of security can be achieved at a reasonable cost. If this is the case, you can then
                        derive specific security requirements for the system. You do not have information about potential vulnerabilities in the system or the controls that are included
                        in reused system components or middleware.</li>
                    <li><b>Life-cycle risk assessment</b> - This risk assessment takes place during the system
                        development life cycle and is informed by the technical system design and
                        implementation decisions. The results of the assessment may lead to changes to
                        the security requirements and the addition of new requirements. Known and
                        potential vulnerabilities are identified and this knowledge is used to inform
                        decision making about the system functionality and how it is to be implemented,
                        tested, and deployed.</li>
                    <li><B>Operational risk assessment</B> - After a system has been deployed and put into
                        use, risk assessment should continue to take account of how the system is used and proposals for new and changed requirements. Assumptions about
                        the operating requirement made when the system was specified may be incorrect. Organizational changes may mean that the system is used in different
                        ways from those originally planned. Operational risk assessment therefore
                        leads to new security requirements that have to be implemented as the system
                        evolves.</li>
                </ol>

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Preliminary risk assessment focuses on deriving security requirements. In
                Chapter 12, I show how an initial set of security requirements may be derived from a
                preliminary risk assessment. In this section, I concentrate on life cycle and operational risk assessment to illustrate how the specification and design of a system are
                influenced by technology and the way that the system is used.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Pfleeger and Pfleeger (2007) characterize threats under four headings, which may
                be used as a starting point for identifying possible misuse cases. These headings are
                as follows:
                
                <ol class="list-dics pl-12 mt-5 list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><b>Interception threats</b> that allow an attacker to gain access to an asset. So, a possible misuse case for the MHC-PMS might be a situation where an attacker gains
                        access to the records of an individual celebrity patient.</li>
                    <li><b>Interruption threats</b> that allow an attacker to make part of the system unavailable. Therefore, a possible misuse case might be a denial of service attack on a
                        system database server.</li>
                    <li><b>Modification threats</b> that allow an attacker to tamper with a system asset. In the
                        MHC-PMS, this could be represented by a misuse case where an attacker
                        changes the information in a patient record.</li>
                    <li><b>Fabrication threats</b> that allow an attacker to insert false information into a system. This is perhaps not a credible threat in the MHC-PMS but would certainly
                        be a threat in a banking system, where false transactions might be added to the
                        system that transfer money to the perpetratorâ€™s bank account.</li>
                </ol>

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Misuse cases are not just useful in preliminary risk assessment but may be used
                for security analysis in life-cycle risk analysis and operational risk analysis. They
                provide a useful basis for playing out hypothetical attacks on the system and assessing the security implications of design decisions that have been made.</p>
            
            <img src="14.2.png" alt="" class="mx-auto h-50 w-80 sm:h-70 sm:w-100 xl:h-110 xl:w-160  rounded-lg hover:scale-110 duration-300">

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Based on organizational security policies, preliminary risk assessment should identify the most important security requirements for a system. These reflect how the
                security policy should be implemented in that application, identify the assets to be
                protected, and decide what approach should be used to provide that protection.
                However, maintaining security is about paying attention to detail. It is impossible for
                the initial security requirements to take all details that affect security into account.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Life-cycle risk assessment identifies the design and implementation details that
                affect security. This is the important distinction between life-cycle risk assessment
                and preliminary risk assessment. Life-cycle risk assessment affects the interpretation
                of existing security requirements, generates new requirements, and influences the
                overall design of the system.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">When assessing risks at this stage, you should have much more detailed information
                about what needs to be protected, and you also will know something about the vulnerabilities in the system. Some of these vulnerabilities will be inherent in the design choices
                made. For example, a vulnerability in all password-based systems is that an authorized
                user reveals their password to an unauthorized user. Alternatively, if an organization has
                a policy of developing software in C, you will know that the application may have vulnerabilities because the language does not include array bound checking.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Security risk assessment should be part of all life-cycle activities from requirements engineering to system deployment. The process followed is similar to the preliminary risk assessment process with the addition of activities concerned with
                design vulnerability identification and assessment. The outcome of the risk assessment is a set of engineering decisions that affect the system design or implementation, or limit the way in which it is used.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">A model of the life-cycle risk analysis process, based on the preliminary risk
                analysis process that I described in Figure 12.9, is shown in Figure 14.2. The most important difference between these processes is that you now have information
                about information representation and distribution and the database organization for
                the high-level assets that have to be protected. You are also aware of important
                design decisions such as the software to be reused, infrastructure controls and protection, etc. Based on this information, your analysis identifies changes to the security requirements and the system design to provide additional protection for the
                important system assets.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Two examples illustrate how protection requirements are influenced by decisions
                on information representation and distribution:</p>

                <ol class="list-dics ml-12 mt-5 list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><b>~</b> You may make a design decision to separate personal patient information and
                        information about treatments received, with a key linking these records. The
                        treatment information is much less sensitive than the personal patient information so may not need as extensive protection. If the key is protected, then an
                        attacker will only be able to access routine information, without being able to
                        link this to an individual patient.</li>
                    <li><b>~</b> Assume that, at the beginning of a session, a design decision is made to copy
                        patient records to a local client system. This allows work to continue if the
                        server is unavailable. It makes it possible for a health-care worker to access
                        patient records from a laptop, even if no network connection is available.
                        However, you now have two sets of records to protect and the client copies are
                        subject to additional risks, such as theft of the laptop computer. You, therefore,
                        have to think about what controls should be used to reduce risk. For example,
                        client records on the laptop may have to be encrypted.</li>
                </ol>

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">To illustrate how decisions on development technologies influence security,
                assume that the health-care provider has decided to build a MHC-PMS using an offthe-shelf information system for maintaining patient records. This system has to be
                configured for each type of clinic in which it is used. This decision has been made
                because it appears to offer the most extensive functionality for the lowest development cost and fastest deployment time.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">When you develop an application by reusing an existing system, you have to
                accept the design decisions made by the developers of that system. Let us assume
                that some of these design decisions are as follows:</p>

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">For a generic system, these design decisions are perfectly acceptable, but a lifecycle risk analysis reveals that they have associated vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, you then have to make a decision on
                what steps that you can take to reduce the associated risks. This will often involve
                making decisions about additional system security requirements or the operational
                process of using the system. I donâ€™t have space here to discuss all the requirements
                that might be proposed to address the inherent vulnerabilities, but some examples of
                requirements might be the following:</p>

                <table class="feature-table w-full border-collapse my-4">

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="border border-gray-400 text-center font-poppins px-4 py-3">1.</td>
                            <td class="border border-gray-400 font-poppins px-4 py-3">A password checker program shall be made available and shall be run daily.

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="border border-gray-400 text-center font-poppins px-4 py-3">2.</td>
                            <td class="border border-gray-400 font-poppins px-4 py-3">Access to the system shall only be allowed to client computers that have been approved and registered with the system administrators.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                            <td class="border border-gray-400 font-poppins px-4 py-3">All client computers shall have a single web browser installed as approved by system administrators.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">As an off-the-shelf system is used, it isnâ€™t possible to include a password checker in
                the application system itself, so a separate system must be used. Password checkers analyze the strength of user passwords when they are set up, and notify users if they have
                chosen weak passwords. Therefore, vulnerable passwords can be identified reasonably quickly after they have been set up, and action can then be taken to ensure that users
                change their password.</p>
            <p class="indent-8 mt-4">The second and third requirements mean that all users will always access the system through the same browser. You can decide what is the most secure browser when
                  the system is deployed and install that on all client computers. Security updates are
                  simplified because there is no need to update different browsers when security vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed.</p>

        <h2>Operational risk management</h2>

        <p class="indent-8 mt-4">Security risk assessment should continue throughout the lifetime of the system to
            identify emerging risks and system changes that may be required to cope with these
            risks. This process is called operational risk assessment. New risks may emerge
            because of changing system requirements, changes in the system infrastructure, or
            changes in the environment in which the system is used.</p>
        <p class="indent-8 mt-4">The process of operational risk assessment is similar to the life-cycle risk assessment process, but with the addition of further information about the environment in
            which the system is used. The environment is important because characteristics of
            the environment can lead to new risks to the system. For example, say a system is
            being used in an environment in which users are frequently interrupted. A risk is that
            the interruption will mean that the user has to leave their computer unattended. It
            may then be possible for an unauthorized person to gain access to the information in
            the system. This could then generate a requirement for a password-protected screen
            saver to be run after a short period of inactivity.</p>
